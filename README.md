# TheTaleOfTheArtfulRyllic
The Tale of the Artful Ryllic is a 2D side-scrolling platformer game I made for my Level Design course at the University of Silicon Valley. The game was created in Unity using C# and the majority of the art and music was made by me. In this game, you play as a creature named Ryllic who must use his special Transform ability to make it to the end of each level.Â
